# NuxtJS With Typescript Example Template

An example template made using [Nuxt.js](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) and Typescript to start a new project. The template is setup with Prettier, ESLint, StyleLint and Lint Staged.

## Why this template

I made this template because I have to set up every time Prettier, ESLint, StyleLint and Lint Staged for my new Nuxt.js projects. And I thought this might be useful for developers who are looking for configuration or starter or example templates.

## Before getting started

Make sure you have installed [Node.js 16.11.0 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple node version on your machine.

## Getting started

You can setup this project using npm or yarn package managers.

> I would recommend to installed or enabled [yarn 3.1.1 or higher](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started) package manager on your machine.
